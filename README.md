# achievements

A collection of all the "achievements" for the course
"Imperative and Object-Oriented Programming Methodology" @ Uppsala University.
GitHub Issues is a perfect fit to see what's done, create milestones and
collaborating.

If you're doing the course, you can create your own "achievements" project by
going to http://achieve.novium.pw OR running your own instance. This requires
using Elixir and Node to compile the source code that you can find in a
repo called "achieve".
